## Prerequisites

You need

- [Node.js 8+][node]

- [Visual Studio Code Project Manager][vscode-pm] - Only if you like to have a project manager for VS Code.

**Note for Insiders Edition users:**

Remember to set the `vscodeEdition` variable to `code-insiders` in the Workflow Configuration!

It defaults to `code`.

specific project or group. The overall list shows 100 projects at max.

Select a project and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open it in VS Code or Code Insiders.

Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> when pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open the project path in Terminal - You can set
the terminal app in the Workflow variables view.

Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> when pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open the project path in Finder.

### Folders / Files

Type `vs` followed by space and search for a specific folder or file to open in Visual Studio Code.

Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> when pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open that folder or file in a new VS Code window.

## Alfred Theme

The Alfred Theme you can see in the screenshot is the [Alfred Snazzy Theme][alfred-theme] from Michele Gerarduzzi. Thanks for this great theme. I've done some slightly adjustments to font and margin sizes.

## Special Thanks

Big Thanks goes to [Cloudstek][cloudstek] for his [Alfred Atom Workflow][alfred-atom] which I used as a base for this project.
